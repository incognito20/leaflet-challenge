### Leaflet Challenge

### Summary

The Leaflet Challenge is a data visualization project using data from the United States Geological Survey. It involves using a JSON feed of earthquake data and visualizing the information so that the data can be more easily understood. 

### File Information

Leaflet-Part-1/static/js/logic.js = The code required to complete Part 1 as described below.

Leaflet-Part-1/index.html = The provided index.html for this project.

Leaflet-Part-1/*.* = All other files provided as part of this project (unmodified).


### Part 1

In Part 1 of this challenge a dataset is selected from the USGS. "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" is the dataset used in this visualization. The visualization provides plots of all earthquakes by their size and depth. Higher magnitude earthquakes appear larger while earthquakes from greater depths appear darker. When clicking on individual markers the location, depth, and magnitude of the event is provided.

### Part 2

Part 2 of this challenge was optional and is not contained in this repo.
